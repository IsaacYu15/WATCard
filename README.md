# WATCard
Managing and budgeting your WATCard (Waterloo's debit card for making on-campus purchases) is quite challenging for Waterloo students! This project aims to help students 
manage their WATCard spending by offering additional budgeting tools that are not currently offered on Waterloo's WATCard website. Some features I'm currently implementing
include:
- Graphs to show daily spending (e.g. line graphs, heat maps, etc)
- How much on average a student spends per day versus how much they should be spending (i.e a way to predict if you are going to run out of money given your spending habits)
- Exporting to a spreadsheet
